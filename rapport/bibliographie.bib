In this problem, the traditional objective of minimizing total distance or time traveled by the vehicles is replaced by minimizing the sum of arrival times at the customers. We propose a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for obtaining optimal solutions to the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published exact algorithm for the CCVRP. We present computational results based on a set of standard CVRP benchmarks and investigate the effect of modifying the number of vehicles available.},

	abstract = {This article concerns the location of satellite distribution centers (SDCs) to supply humanitarian aid to the affected people throughout a disaster area. In such situations, it is not possible for the relief teams to visit every single home. Instead, the people are required to go to a satellite distribution center in order to obtain survival goods, provided that these centers are not too far from their homes. The SDCs are usually within walking distance. However, these SDCs need to be supplied from a central depot, using a heterogeneous and capacitated fleet of vehicles. We model this situation as a generalization of the covering tour problem, introduce the idea of split delivery, and propose an efficient heuristic approach to solve it. Numerical experiments on randomly-generated data show that, first, only very small instances can be solved efficiently using the mathematical model and, second, our heuristic produces high-quality solutions and solves real-size instances in a reasonable computing time.},

The CCVRP generalizes the NP-hard traveling repairman problem (TRP), by adding capacity constraints and a homogeneous vehicle fleet. This paper presents the first upper and lower bounding procedures for this new problem. The lower bounds are derived from CCVRP properties. Upper bounds are given by a memetic algorithm using non-trivial evaluations of cost variations in the local search.

Central to disaster relief logistics is the distribution of life-saving commodities to beneficiaries.

Through interviews with aid organizations, reviews of their publications, and a literature review of operations research models in transportation of relief goods, this paper provides an analysis of the use of such models from the perspective of both practitioners and academics.

	abstract = {The multi-vehicle covering tour problem is defined on a graph G=(V∪W, E), where W is a set of vertices that must collectively be covered by up to m vehicles. The problem consists of determining a set of total minimum length vehicle routes on a subset of V, subject to side constraints, such that every vertex of W is within a prespecified distance from a route. Three heuristics are developed for this problem and tested on randomly generated and real data. Scope and purpose In the problem considered in this article, we are given two sets of locations. The first set, V, consists of potential locations at which some vehicles may stop, and the second set, W are locations not actually on vehicle routes, but within an acceptable distance of a vehicle route. The problem is to construct several vehicle routes through a subset of V, all starting and ending at the same locations, subject to some side constraints, having a total minimum length, and such that every location of W is within a reasonable distance of a route. A common application of this problem arises in the delivery of health care facilities by mobile units in developing countries. Here, vehicles travel through a limited number of villages, and every location that is not visited must be within walking distance of a visited location. This article proposes three heuristics capable of solving instances of realistic size within reasonable computing times.},

First a single-objective path selection model is presented taking into account that the travel speed on each arc will be affected by disaster extension. The objective of the model is to minimize total travel time along a path. The travel speed on each arc is modeled as a continuous decrease function with respect to time. A modified Dijkstra algorithm is designed to solve the model. Based on the first model, we further consider the chaos, panic and congestions in time of disaster. A multi-objective path selection model is presented to minimize the total travel time along a path and to minimize the path complexity. The complexity of the path is modeled as the total number of arcs included in the path. An ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the model.

The presented proof of strong N P -completeness of the problem is provided by a reduction from 3-PARTITION. Since recent literature provides significant new results for further variants of the Line-TRP and the Line-TSP, a brief updated overview of the complexity status of the different variants is given. Another major contribution is that a practically applicable exact best-first search Branch\&amp;Bound approach that optimally solves instances of real-world size in reasonable time is proposed. By applying sophisticated dominance rules as well as lower bounds, the number of enumerated partial solutions is kept limited.

	abstract = {In this paper, the authors introduce two bicriterion routing problems: the median tour problem (MTP) and the maximal covering tour problem (MCTP). In both problems the tour must visit only p of the n nodes on the network. In addition, both problems have as one of their objectives the minimization of total tour length. The second objective in both problems maximizes access to the tour for the nodes not directly on it. In the MTP, the access objective is the minimization of the total travel distance necessary for demand at the nodes to reach their nearest stop on the tour. In the MCTP, the access objective is to maximize the total demand within some prespecified maximal travel distance from a tour stop. It is shown that the MCTP may be viewed as a special case of the MTP; consequently, solution procedures developed for the MTP may also be employed to solve the MCTP. Unfortunately, both problems are NP-hard. In addition, the number of efficient solutions may grow exponentially with the number of nodes in the particular problem instance. Consequently a heuristic procedure is developed to generate a good approximation of the efficient frontier. Not only does this approximation provide the decision marker with insight into the magnitudes of the inherent tradeoffs between the two objectives, but it also provides him or her with a set of feasible options to consider. Computational experience, on a realistically scaled problem, is provided. Applications of the problems include the design of mobile service delivery systems (e.g. healthcare delivery in rural areas of developing countries), bi-modal transportation systems (e.g. overnight mail delivery), and distributed computer networks, among others.},

The problem is to provide a sufficient number of facilities to be geographically accessible, yet few enough to be properly stocked and staffed. In many less developed countries accessibility problems are exacerbated by extensive rainy seasons in which travel is only possible on paved roads. Using the covering tour model we investigate the use of mobile facilities to resolve this dilemma in Suhum District, Ghana. The model minimizes a mobile facility's travel while serving all population centers within range of a feasible stop. Computational results show that in the rainy season the model cannot provide full coverage; over six percent of the population is beyond a covering distance of eight kilometers. In the dry season, 99 percent of the population can be served by a tour at a covering distance of seven kilometers.Beyond a distance of four kilometers, the dry season problem becomes a trade-off between the distance traveled by healthcare patrons and mobile facilities. These results illustrate the importance of flexibility of mobile systems: if accessibility cannot be provided in all seasons it may still be provided at favorable times of the year.},
